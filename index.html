                <h1> Will Eand</h1>
                <p>  My goal is to become a full stack engineer, focusing on using technology to solve real-world problems. 
                    I'm especially passionate about mentoring and guiding young people in my community, helping them develop strong habits and envision brighter futures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my studies, I devote time to volunteering and community service. Whether it's coding projects or mentoring initiatives, I believe in using technology to empower and uplift others. 
                    My mission is to blend my technical skills with a commitment to education and community development, making a meaningful impact in both the tech industry and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm driven by the belief that education and mentorship can create positive change. 
                    Through my work, I strive to inspire young minds and contribute to building a stronger, more supportive community.
